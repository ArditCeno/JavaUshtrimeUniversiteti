## About the Project

This repository contains multiple seminar folders, each representing a different set of Java exercises covered during university sessions.
The exercises gradually increase in difficulty, starting from basic syntax and moving toward Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
It is intended for:

- University students learning Java  
- Beginners who want structured practice  
- Revision before exams  
- Personal experimentation with Java
